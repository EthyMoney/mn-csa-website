# MN FRC CSA Support Website

This is the repository for the event CSA help request site for Minnesota First Robotics Competition events. This is a simple submission form website that collects information about a team and the issue they are having. This information is then sent to an internal Trello board used by the onsite control system advisors (CSAs) to help them more efficiently help teams during competition events.

Created by Logan Steffen, a Minnesota CSA of 5 years. This is still in development and is not yet ready for use quite yet, but is in a functional demo state. Will be made functional on the backend and and add some additional features (like non-event support requests and seeing your place in the queue) within the first week or so of the 2024 build season. Check back later!
